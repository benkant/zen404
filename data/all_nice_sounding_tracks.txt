Now, it's time to choose the lad's tracks from a bunch of songs I like.

A few caveats:
- Some of these tracks may be on the female list I gave and are disqualified.
- Some of the tracks are nowhere near the male version of the female recordings
- I have basically dumped a subset of recordings I _like the sound of_ but it's otherwise not been curated at all for narrative purposes

Goal:
- Select tracks that are the male counterpoint to the equivalent list I gave for female artists
- The list is long, and you have to do a lot of searching, so we will take it slowly
- From the list, in the existing format, but cleaned up to be a CSV
- Where `male_narrative_arc = True` is the equivalent of a recording from the female track list which would be `female_narrative_arc = True`

`SELECT * FROM recordings_I_like.txt AS male_narrative_selection WHERE male_narrative_arc = True ORDER BY id LIMIT 30`

We will go through the list, from start to finish. You will go through as many rows as necessary, selecting `WHERE male_narrative_arc = True` until you've got 30 recordings. We will continue this process until we've selected all such recordings.

Generate the first 30 selections in order (that is, [I'm explaining this to a computer which seems silly]) starting from the first row, and checking if it meets the criteria, selecting it to generate in the CSV if so, and if not, skip it.
