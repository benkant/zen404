	•	SP-404MKII – Effects processing and resampling.
	•	Roland T-8 – Drum and bassline generation.
	•	Roland S-1 – Mono synth for stabs, risers, and motifs.
	•	KeyStep 37 – MIDI input controller.
	•	Focusrite Scarlett 4i4 (4th Gen) – Audio interface with 4 inputs and MIDI I/O.

🎚️ Signal Chain (“Ghetto Fabulous” Edition)

Logic Pro X (MIDI) → SP-404MKII → DS-1 (L/R) → CS-3 (L/R) → Scarlett 4i4 → Logic Pro X (Audio)

	•	Stereo Processing: By using two DS-1 and two CS-3 pedals, you maintain stereo integrity, essential for a wide and immersive soundstage.
	•	Gain Staging: Ensure the output from the SP-404MKII is appropriately leveled to prevent overdriving the DS-1 inputs, maintaining clarity and preventing unwanted distortion.
	•	Logic Integration: Logic handles MIDI sequencing and records the processed audio, allowing for further refinement and arrangement.
