üéõÔ∏è Studio Remix Blueprint Summary (Radio Soulwax-Inspired)

üéØ Objective

You‚Äôre building studio-constructed, narrative-driven remix sets using hardware (SP-404MKII, Roland T-8, S-1) and Logic Pro X. The style is inspired by As Heard on Radio Soulwax Pt. 2, but more cinematic, structured, and emotionally arc-driven ‚Äî not DAW timelines or live jams. Your workflow uses pre-sequenced samples and MIDI routed through pedals and outboard-style FX chains for punchy, character-heavy results.

‚∏ª

üß† Narrative Concept
	‚Ä¢	The first story is a ‚Äúboy meets girl‚Äù arc using Dan Harmon‚Äôs Story Circle (8 steps).
	‚Ä¢	Each step contains 3 sequences √ó 2 scenes √ó 4 phrases = 192 total phrases.
	‚Ä¢	Each scene is a remix unit: 56 bars, subdivided into:

Phrase	Function
Hook 1	Male protagonist in his natural, laddish state
Bridge	Contrast ‚Äî female counterpoint enters
Hook 2	Escalation or blending of both voices
Transition	Reflective or narrative shift, often female-led

Male = reckless, cheeky, energetic.
Female = grounded, humorous, transformative.

‚∏ª

üéöÔ∏è Gear Architecture (Hybrid, ‚ÄúGhetto Fabulous‚Äù Edition)
	‚Ä¢	Logic Pro X = master sequencer + MIDI brain
	‚Ä¢	SP-404MKII = pad sampler, FX box, and resampler
	‚Ä¢	Koala Sampler (iPad) = phrase sampling and triggering
	‚Ä¢	Roland T-8 = rhythm (MIDI-synced)
	‚Ä¢	Roland S-1 = mono synth for punctuation
	‚Ä¢	KeyStep 37 = note entry via MIDI
	‚Ä¢	Scarlett 4i4 = audio+MIDI interface (temp until SSL BiG SiX)

üß© Signal Chain (Stereo with Dual Mono Pedals)

Logic MIDI ‚Üí SP-404MKII ‚Üí [DS-1 (L)] ‚Üí [CS-3 (L)] ‚Üí Scarlett In 1
                           ‚Üò [DS-1 (R)] ‚Üí [CS-3 (R)] ‚Üí Scarlett In 2

Pedals are doubled for stereo preservation. SP-404 audio is processed through dual BOSS chains before being recorded back into Logic.

This emulates an outboard mixbus on a tight budget ‚Äî compression, grit, and colour pre-DAW.

üíµ Budget Gear Plan (~$1,000 AUD)
	‚Ä¢	2√ó BOSS DS-1 Distortion ‚âà $170
	‚Ä¢	2√ó BOSS CS-3 Compressor ‚âà $330
	‚Ä¢	Scarlett 4i4 (Gen 4) ‚âà $350
	‚Ä¢	Total ‚âà $850 AUD

‚∏ª

üîä Production Philosophy
	‚Ä¢	Not lo-fi or nostalgic.
	‚Ä¢	Surgical pop energy, like ‚Äúa clean operating theatre‚Ä¶ full of blood and guts.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	SSL-style clarity, fast transient response, minimal reverb.
	‚Ä¢	Vocals and samples are clean, dry, mid-forward.
	‚Ä¢	SP-404 is treated like a surgical tool ‚Äî resample, chop, route, commit.

‚∏ª

üß± Song Selection Strategy
	‚Ä¢	Girl Parts: Tracks from female-fronted pop/rock/electronic acts across the past 50 years.
	‚Ä¢	Function as chorus, contrast, emotional guidance, and transformation points.
	‚Ä¢	Examples: Running Up That Hill, I Touch Myself, Lovefool, Dreams, No Ordinary Love
	‚Ä¢	Lad‚Äôs Tackle: Punky, dry, mid-heavy, attitude-forward recordings.
	‚Ä¢	Focus on punchy, fast-transient SSL-style mixes or raw analog boards.
	‚Ä¢	Examples: You Really Got Me, Teenage Kicks, Common People, Fix You, Anarchy in the UK, Lust for Life
	‚Ä¢	Tracks are assigned by narrative phase and function (e.g., Bridge = female-led pivot, Hook 1 = male solo, etc.).

‚∏ª

üìñ Narrative Mapping (Simplified)

Step	Meaning	Example Track (Lad)	Example Track (Girl)
YOU	Lad‚Äôs stable, cheeky self	Teenage Kicks	Girls Just Wanna Have Fun
NEED	Glimpse of desire / dissatisfaction	Ever Fallen in Love	Running Up That Hill
GO	Pursuit of excitement / change	Substitute	Self Control
SEARCH	Collapse / confusion / intensity	Transmission	Seether
FIND	Euphoric moment / hook revelation	Common People	I Wanna Dance With Somebody
TAKE	Emotional cost / consequences	Fix You	Criminal
RETURN	Motifs reappear, more mature	Won‚Äôt Get Fooled Again	Dreams
CHANGE	Final state ‚Äî integrated self	Rock On	No Ordinary Love

üé∂ Track Selection Process for Harmon's Story Circle (Male Protagonist Narrative)

The selection of tracks for the "Lad's Tackle" (male protagonist) list is a deliberate process aimed at mirroring the emotional and developmental journey through Dan Harmon's 8-Step Story Circle. The goal is to create a compelling counterpoint to the "Girl Parts" list, reflecting the protagonist's transformation from a carefree, somewhat immature individual to a more mature and emotionally aware person, largely influenced by his relationship.

For each of the 8 stages, a track is chosen based on the following considerations:

1.  **Stage 1: You (The Protagonist in their Ordinary World)**
    *   **Vibe:** Carefree, energetic, laddish, perhaps a bit cheeky or rebellious but ultimately harmless. Focus on his established persona and lifestyle *before* the inciting incident.
    *   **Sonic Qualities:** Often upbeat indie rock, punk, Britpop, garage rock, or hip-hop with a party/observational feel. Can also include high-energy electronic tracks that evoke a sense of youthful abandon.
    *   **Narrative Function:** Establishes the baseline character.

2.  **Stage 2: Need (Something's not right, a desire emerges)**
    *   **Vibe:** A dawning awareness, a subtle yearning, infatuation, or the first hint that the current state isn't entirely fulfilling. This is often sparked by the first encounter or significant thought about the "girl."
    *   **Sonic Qualities:** Can range from dream pop and new wave to more introspective indie or even melancholic electronic pieces. The sound often has a touch of wonder, confusion, or longing.
    *   **Narrative Function:** Introduces the internal or external motivation for change.

3.  **Stage 3: Go (Crossing the threshold, the pursuit begins)**
    *   **Vibe:** Active pursuit, excitement, determination, perhaps a bit of nervous energy or clumsy enthusiasm. The protagonist decides to act on the 'need.'
    *   **Sonic Qualities:** Typically energetic tracks ‚Äì power pop, dance-punk, driving indie rock, upbeat electronic (like French House). The music should feel propulsive.
    *   **Narrative Function:** The protagonist actively tries to get what they want.

4.  **Stage 4: Search (The road of trials, challenges, and self-reflection)**
    *   **Vibe:** Struggle, confusion, emotional turmoil, learning, adapting. This stage can involve setbacks, moments of doubt, or intense experiences.
    *   **Sonic Qualities:** Diverse ‚Äì can be darker post-punk, angsty alternative rock, complex experimental electronic, or even reflective anthems that speak to perseverance. The sound reflects the difficulty and intensity of this phase.
    *   **Narrative Function:** The protagonist faces obstacles.

5.  **Stage 5: Find (Grasping what was sought, a moment of revelation)**
    *   **Vibe:** A breakthrough, a significant connection made, a realization, euphoria, or a pivotal moment of understanding the value of the pursued goal (the relationship).
    *   **Sonic Qualities:** Often anthemic, uplifting, or deeply heartfelt. Britpop, soaring indie rock, euphoric electronic tracks, or sincere ballads fit well here.
    *   **Narrative Function:** The protagonist gets what they wanted, at least initially.

6.  **Stage 6: Take (Paying the price, consequences, sacrifice, embracing change)**
    *   **Vibe:** Acknowledging the cost of the new reality, embracing vulnerability, making sacrifices, or fully committing to the change. This can be a point of no return.
    *   **Sonic Qualities:** Can be emotionally intense ballads, songs of commitment, vulnerable indie folk, or electronic tracks that have a sense of momentous decision or surrender.
    *   **Narrative Function:** The protagonist deals with the consequences of their actions.

7.  **Stage 7: Return (Bringing it home, changed)**
    *   **Vibe:** Reintegrating into life but with a new perspective, often more mature, confident, or having found a new 'normal.' There's a sense of having journeyed and come back transformed.
    *   **Sonic Qualities:** Can be reflective indie rock, sophisticated pop, smooth electronic, or tracks that convey a sense of settled, wiser confidence.
    *   **Narrative Function:** The protagonist returns to their ordinary world, but transformed.

8.  **Stage 8: Change (Mastery, final transformation, new status quo)**
    *   **Vibe:** The protagonist is fundamentally different. There's a sense of resolution, mature understanding, and a new, stable emotional state.
    *   **Sonic Qualities:** Can be expansive, emotionally resonant tracks ‚Äì orchestral indie, profound ballads, serene ambient electronic, or confident anthems that signify a deep internal shift.
    *   **Narrative Function:** The protagonist demonstrates they have changed.

Throughout this process, consideration is given to diversifying the sonic palette (incorporating pre-90s classics, well-aged electronic music, etc.) to match the breadth of the "Girl Parts" list and the project's overall aesthetic goals, while ensuring each track serves its specific narrative purpose within the 8-step journey.

üß™ Sound Texture & Reference
	‚Ä¢	You curated selections that deviate from the clean SSL mix aesthetic by introducing:
	‚Ä¢	Experimental synth textures (Art of Noise, Aphex Twin)
	‚Ä¢	Ambient/glitch layers (Autechre, Sigur R√≥s, Moby)
	‚Ä¢	Sample-heavy funk/electronic blends (DJ Shadow, The Avalanches)

Aimed for SSL-style punch meets varied electronica depth.

‚∏ª

üßæ Final Notes
	‚Ä¢	The system is hardware-driven, studio-sequenced, character-first.
	‚Ä¢	You‚Äôre designing a structured remix narrative:
	‚Ä¢	Pre-chopped samples (via Koala/Logic)
	‚Ä¢	Routed through character FX (SP-404 + BOSS)
	‚Ä¢	Tracked into Logic for final assembly
	‚Ä¢	Logic is justified in your workflow (Soulwax use Pro Tools and Ableton; you‚Äôre using Logic in the same role ‚Äî arrangement and sequencing).

üß® Operating Room Manifesto (Short Form)

I don‚Äôt chase lo-fi.
I don‚Äôt chase warmth.
I chase blood on the floor.

This is not nostalgia.
This is a surgical theatre ‚Äî
Where loops are prepped, pads are triggers,
and every sound is sharpened before it‚Äôs cut.

If the track doesn‚Äôt shimmer,
doesn‚Äôt slam,
doesn‚Äôt bleed a little ‚Äî
I‚Äôm not done cutting.
